This file describes how to run the testsuite for the software correlator.

The test suite is located on huygens at /data4/sfxc/test_suite/

It contains directories:
  * data
  * origininal
  * other test suites

data
----

The data directory contains the input data: the vex-files and the
mark5 data. The data is from old ftp-fringe tests.

original
--------

This contains the original test suite. I ran the testsuite once in
this directory to have a reverence output.

The directory contains two scripts:
 * clear_all.py that removes all previous output
 * run_all.py   that runs all tests in the test-suite
    - it runs the software correlator for every control file
    - it generates a difference plot with respect to the output in
      original

The original directory contains a subdirectory for every experiment
that we want to test. These directories contain:
 * control files
 * html directories where html_produce_plotpage puts its output
 * html_diff directories where html_produce_diffpage puts its output
   The output in the original directory is taken for reference.



other directories
-----------------

The other directories are copies of the "original" directory.
