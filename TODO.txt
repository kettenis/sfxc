TODO:

Control files
- check for redundancies and remove them [RHJO]
- add run option for analyses of mk4 files and print/write headers, 
  maybe in a separate application
- Set random generator with a well defined seed in the control file
  option: fixed seeding and runtime based seeding
- which parameters can be extracted from vex file
- store the control files in XML format
- mark files as "file:///path/filename" in order to be able to use
  "tcp://host:port" and "mark5://host:port" later as well

Correlation:
- create a Correlator class with status functions 
- Document classes
- Data_writer and Output_node for collecting data
- Remove global variables
- Parameters: welke wordt waar gebruikt, gezet? Documentatie
- check timestamps in the headers during correlation
- optimize code: 
  - FFTw in place, 
  - std::vectors instead of arrays with fixed length
  - std::string instead of char * to ease the copy constructor
- move header_map_mk4_cx.txt to a header file
- do a FindOffsets before every integration step

Multi core:
- Data_writer similar to Data_reader
- Add Data_reader 
      Data_writer
- send time slices, manage nodes
- Get sfxc_adam working again
- schrijven van debug informatie (niet naar std::cout)

Functionality:
- add overlapping in correlation [RHJO]
- add filtering before delay correction [RHJO]
- Convertor: from correlator product to FITS format. [RHJO]
  Develop separate application or integrate whith correlator software

Documentation
- high level documentation document, describing what happens and how
  it happens in the sw correlator. See also deliverable DJ 1.4
  in DoW. [RHJO]
- Write doxygen code for the control parameters

Test:
- Complete test_suite
- add .sfxc file with control information per computer

General:
- check in original sw correlator code using cxmk4, cx2fl, delpha and sfxct
  (in a separate module)

Questions:
- Why are parabCoefs and getDelayLine not members of DelayTable?
- Why not using a standard number generator? Ask Max (NGHK)

STATUS:
If an action item is not mentioned nothing is done yet.
Copy action item to this list and describe status (date, who, what)

1. [RHJO, 11-01-2007] 
  high level documentation document, describing what happens and how
  it happens in the sw correlator. See also deliverable DJ 1.4
  in DoW. [RHJO]
2. [RHJO, 11-01-2007] check for redundancies and remove them [RHJO]
3. [RHJO, 11-01-2007] 
   - create a Correlator class with status functions 
   - Remove global variables (RunPrms, GenPrms, StaPrms)
   - Parameters: welke wordt waar gebruikt, gezet?
   - Documentatie Correlator class

1. [YP, 11-01-2007] Make fringe plots from the correlator output
2. [YP, 11-01-2007] Make a utility to transfer the correlator output to FITS


3. [NGHK, 11-01-2007]
   - Data_writer and Output_node for collecting data
4. [NGHK, 11-01-2007]
   - Connect all nodes using a controller node


DONE:
Move action item from TODO list to DONE list

- [NGHK, 17-01-2007] Log_writer and Log_node for writing logging information
- [NGHK, 16-01-2007] Write doxygen code for the control parameters
- [NGHK, 16-01-2007] delayTable: use milliseconds instead of seconds for time
  [NGHK, 15-01-2007] Remove global variables
- [NGHK, 12-01-2007] switch to svn
- [NGHK, 11-01-2007] Send messages for control parameters (MPI version).
- [NGHK, 11-01-2007] Create a utility directory (c2f, etc.)
