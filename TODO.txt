TODO:

Control files
- check for redundancies and remove them [RHJO]
- add run option for analyses of mk4 files and print/write headers [RHJO]
- Set random generator with a well defined seed in the control file [RHJO]
  option: fixed seeding and runtime based seeding
- which parameters can be extracted from vex file [RHJO]

Correlation:
- create a Correlator class with status functions 
- Why not using a standard number generator?
- Document classes
- Data_writer and Output_node for collecting data
- Remove global variables
- Send messages for control parameters.
- Create a utility directory (c2f, etc.)
- Parameters: welke wordt waar gebruikt, gezet? Documentatie
- Global variables: global parameters en:
  INT64 sliceStartByte[NstationsMax][NprocessesMax];
  INT64 sliceStartTime[NprocessesMax];
  INT64 sliceStopTime [NprocessesMax];
  INT64 sliceTime;
  are they necessary and where are they set
- check timestamps in the headers during correlation
- instead of one correlator product file per process these have to be
  concatenated into one correlator product file [RHJO]

Multi core:
- Data_writer similar to Data_reader
- Add Data_reader 
      Data_writer
- send time slices, manage nodes
- Get sfxc_adam working again
- schrijven van debug informatie (niet naar \verb~std::cout~)

Functionality:
- add overlapping in correlation [RHJO]
- add filtering before delay correction [RHJO]
- Convertor: from correlator product to FITS format.
  Develop separate application or integrate whith correlator software

Documentation
- high level documentation document, describing what happens and how
  it happens in the sw correlator. See also deliverable DJ 1.4
  in DoW. [RHJO]

Test:
- Complete test_suite
- add .sfxc file with control information per computer

General:
- switch to svn (to accomodate moving files, check cvs2svn)?
- check in original sw correlator code using cxmk4, cx2fl, delpha and sfxct
