TODO:

Control files
- check for redundancies and remove them [RHJO]
- add run option for analyses of mk4 files and print/write headers, 
  maybe in a separate application
- Set random generator with a well defined seed in the control file
  option: fixed seeding and runtime based seeding
- investigate the option to store the control files in XML format
- mark files as "file:///path/filename" in order to be able to use
  "tcp://host:port" and "mark5://host:port" later as well
- rename certain keywords in control file to more meaningful names
  and synchronize these keywords with the ones generated by vex2ccf
- make simple functional design for ccf editor. This editor is part
  of WFM to be developed by PSNC (Dominik)
- Use a Makefile.am to generate the makefiles used by vex2ccf

Correlation:
- create a Correlator class with status functions 
- Document classes
- Data_writer and Output_node for collecting data
- Remove global variables
- Parameters: welke wordt waar gebruikt, gezet? Documentatie
- check timestamps in the headers during correlation
- optimize code: 
  - FFTW in place,
  - std::vectors instead of arrays with fixed length
  - std::string instead of char * to ease the copy constructor
- move header_map_mk4_cx.txt to a header file
- do a FindOffsets before every integration step
- are all processing steps necessary, which steps do and do not
  contribute to the end result

Multi core:
- Data_writer similar to Data_reader
- Add Data_reader 
      Data_writer
- send time slices, manage nodes
- Get sfxc_adam working again
- schrijven van debug informatie (niet naar std::cout)

Functionality:
- add overlapping in correlation [RHJO]
- add filtering before delay correction [RHJO]
- Convertor: from correlator product to FITS format. [RHJO]
  Develop separate application or integrate whith correlator software

Documentation
- high level documentation document, describing what happens and how
  it happens in the sw correlator. See also deliverable DJ 1.4
  in DoW. [RHJO]
- Write doxygen code for the control parameters

Test:
- Complete test_suite
- add .sfxc file with control information per computer

General:
- check in original sw correlator code using cxmk4, cx2fl, delpha and sfxct
  (in a separate module)

Performance and Optimization
- run benchmark tests on various machines
- add and refine timing in sfxc

Future (possible) developments
- current sfxc (31-1-2007) can correlate only one channel. Should there be a
  multi channel version
- A vex file can describe more  than one mode. Should sfxc be able to handle
  more modes

Questions:
- Why are parabCoefs and getDelayLine not members of DelayTable?
- Why not using a standard number generator? Ask Max (NGHK)

Repository
- add cxmk4, cx2fl, delpha, sfxct including its control files
  this is the original sw correlator
- add vex2ccf including VexPlus and vex parser to svn repository
- add data directory, in this directory are control and vex files


STATUS:
If an action item is not mentioned nothing is done yet.
Copy action item to this list and describe status (date, who, what)

1. [RHJO, 11-01-2007] 
  high level documentation document, describing what happens and how
  it happens in the sw correlator. See also deliverable DJ 1.4
  in DoW. [RHJO]
2. [RHJO, 11-01-2007] check for redundancies and remove them [RHJO]
3. [RHJO, 11-01-2007] 
   - create a Correlator class with status functions 
   - Remove global variables (RunPrms, GenPrms, StaPrms)
   - Parameters: welke wordt waar gebruikt, gezet?
   - Documentatie Correlator class
4. [RHJO, 22-11-2007]
   - investigate to store the control files in XML format. Started with xml design.
     Stop gap job, low priority. See e-mail exchange with Dominik from PSNC
5. [RHJO, 22-11-2007]
   - Convertor: from correlator product (CP)to FITS format. After consulting Harro we
   should convert CP to measurement sets (MS). Advantages:
   a) more flexible way of data storing
   b) Harro has sw able to write MS he only needs to know the CP format and write
      appropriate CP reading sw
6. [RHJO, 30-11-2007]
   - which parameters can be extracted from vex file.
     Application vex2cff designed and implemented. It extracts relevant
     ccf parameters and sets others to default values. vex2ccf uses
     class VexPlus and the official vex parser.      
     

1. [YP, 11-01-2007] Make fringe plots from the correlator output
2. [YP, 11-01-2007] Make a utility to transfer the correlator output to FITS


3. [NGHK, 11-01-2007]
   - Data_writer and Output_node for collecting data
4. [NGHK, 11-01-2007]
   - Connect all nodes using a controller node


DONE:
Move action item from TODO list to DONE list
- [RHJO, 30-01-2007] Control files: which parameters can be extracted from vex file

- [NGHK, 17-01-2007] Log_writer and Log_node for writing logging information
- [NGHK, 16-01-2007] Write doxygen code for the control parameters
- [NGHK, 16-01-2007] delayTable: use milliseconds instead of seconds for time
  [NGHK, 15-01-2007] Remove global variables
- [NGHK, 12-01-2007] switch to svn
- [NGHK, 11-01-2007] Send messages for control parameters (MPI version).
- [NGHK, 11-01-2007] Create a utility directory (c2f, etc.)
