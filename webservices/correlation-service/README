Installation
------------

This software depends on the vex_parser Python module that is part of
the SFXC (in lib/vex_parser/vex_parser).  Note that as part of a
regular SFXC build only the C version of the praser gets built.  To
enable the Python module you'll need to pass the --enable-pythonlib
option to the configure script.

Usage
-----

vex_update.py VEXFILE

This will add $CLOCK and $EOP blocks to a VEX file, or replace the
existing $CLOCK and $EOP sections with updated information.  The EOPs
are calculated based on finals.daily and finals.data as provided by
USNO.  The scripts downloads these files automatically unless there is
a recent cached copy in the current directory.  The clock offsets are
calculated based on GPS/formatter offsets archived on the vlbeer
server.  Again, the files are automatically downloaded.  The script
applies a (bandwidth-dependent) per-station offset provided in the
gps_correction table at the start of the gps.py script.  That table
only contains a limited set of EVN stations.
