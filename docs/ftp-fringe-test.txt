This document describes the steps to do a ftp-fringe-test using the
JIVE sfxc correlator..

1. Compile the software correlator and the utilities.
   See the comments below.
2. Get the vexfile from ccsops:
   scp jops@ccsops:/ccs/expr/<experiment_name>/<vexfile>
3. Produce a sfxc-control file.
   An example is given below.
4. make_sfxc_experiment_makefile <vexfile> <sfxc-control file> <output_dir>
   This produces a makefile for the experiment
5. make -j<N> 
   Generates the ccf files (one per channel) and the delay tables (one
   per channel, one per station) with N parallel processes. These
   control files are generated automatically and are used for the
   correlation.
6. make -j<N> correlate
   Computes the correlation with N parallel processes
7. make html
   Produces the output website


=====================
 compilation of sfxc
=====================

1. aclocal && autoheader && autoconf && automake --add-missing
2. ./configure CXX=mpicxx
3. make
4. cd utils/vex_parser/ && \
   make -f Makefile.v2c sfxc_vex2ccf sfxc_vex2dcf && \
   cd -
5. cd utils/delmo/lib && \
   make && \
   cd ../src && \
   make delmo && \
   cd ../../..
6. You now have the utilities:
   - src/sfxc_SC
   - utils/make_sfxc_experiment_makefile
   - utils/vex_parser/sfxc_vex2ccf
   - utils/vex_parser/sfxc_vex2dcf
   - utils/delmo/src/delmo
   Make them available by copying them in a bin directory or 
   putting them in the path

===========================
 example sfxc-control file
===========================

The sfxc-control file is a json file (www.json.org) that provides the
data needed to correlate the experiment.

======================================
 description of the sfxc-control file
======================================

scan: The scan to correlate, as specified in the vex file

start: The start time of the correlation.

duration: The duration of the correlation in seconds.

refstation: the reference station. This should be the name of one of
  the stations as specified in the vex file.

stations: A list of the stations to correlate. Each station is
  reffered to by the station name in the vex file. The order is not
  important.

mk4file: A list of the names of the mark4 files in the same order as
  the stations are given in the vex-file.

mk4dir: The directory with the mark4 data files

ccfdir: The directory where the correlator control files are
  stored. These are automatically generated and updated

deldir: The directory containing the delay tables. These are
  automatically generated.

outdir: The directory where the output of the correlation is stored

htmldir: The directory where the html page is stored with the fringe-plots

number_of_lags: The number of lags to use in the correlation. This is
  the same as the number of visibilities for the auto correlations.

integration_time: The integration time in seconds

messagelevel: The amount of messages the correlator should produce.
 - 0 no output
 - 1 some output
 - 2 debugging
