Phasecal output is stored in a binary file.  The file starts with a
header that stores some information about the experiment and the
correlator version that produced the data.  The header has the
following structure:

struct header {
  uint32_t header_size;		// Size of header in bytes
  char experiment[32];		// Name of the experiment

  uint32_t output_format_version;	// Version number of the output format
  uint32_t correlator_version;		// SVN revision of the correlator

  char correlator_branch[15];
  int32_t job_nr;
  int32_t subjob_nr;
};

The size of the header is 68 bytes, int32_t designates a signed 32-bit
integer, uint32_t an unsigned 32-bit integer.  Everything is in
little-endian byte order.

After the header there will be data bocks for each
station/channel/integration.  Each data block has the following
structure:

struct data {
  uint8_t station_number;	// Station number
  uint8_t frequency_number;	// Frequency number (based on ascending order)
  uint8_t sideband;		// Sideband LSB=0/USB=1
  uint8_t polarisation;		// Polarisation RCP=0/LCP=1
  uint32_t start_day;		// Start time (integral MJD portion)
  uint32_t start_sec;		// Start time (second within day)
  uint32_t integration_time;	// Integration time in seconds
  uint32_t num_samples;		// Number of samples in vector
  int32_t samples[num_samples]; // Vector of integrated samples
};

Data blocks don't necessarily appear in order.  As long as the
integration time is large enough they will probably appear in time
order, but they will certainly not appear in station/channel order.

Station numbers are assigned by taking all stations from the $STATION
block in the VEX file and sorting the alphabetically.  The numbers
start from zero.  The channels are numbered in the order they appear
in the $FREQ block in the VEX file, again starting from zero.
